// Now we formulate an idealized model of big-step multi-result
// supercompilation.
//
// The knowledge about the input language a supercompiler deals with
// is represented by a "world of supercompilation", which is a trait
// that specifies the following.
//
// * `C` is the type of "configurations". Note that configurations are
//   not required to be just expressions with free variables! In general,
//   they may represent sets of states in any form/language and as well may
//   contain any _additional_ information.
//
// * `isFoldableTo` is a "foldability relation". isFoldableTo(c, c') means
//   that c is foldable to c'.
//   (In such cases c' is usually said to be " more general than c".)
//
// * `develop` is a function that gives a number of possible decompositions of
//   a configuration. Let `c` be a configuration and `cs` a list of
//   configurations such that `cs âˆˆ develop(c)`. Then `c` can be "reduced to"
//   (or "decomposed into") configurations in `cs`.
//
//   Suppose that driving is determinstic and, given a configuration `c`,
//   produces a list of configurations `drive(c)`. Suppose that rebuilding
//   (generalization, application of lemmas) is non-deterministic and
//   `rebuild(c)` is the list of configurations that can be produced by
//   rebuilding. Then (in this special case) `develop` is implemented
//   as follows:
//
//       develop(c) = List(drive(c)) ::: rebuild(c).map(List(_))
//
// * `History` is a list of configuration that have been produced
//   in order to reach the current configuration.
//
// * `isDangerous` is a "whistle" that is used to ensure termination of
//   supercompilation. `isDangerous(h)` means that the history has become
//   "too large".
//
// * `isFoldableToHistory(c, h)` means that `c` is foldable to a configuration
//   in the history `h`.

  // with get-graphs being an "interpreter" that evaluates the "program"
  // returned by lazy_mrsc.
